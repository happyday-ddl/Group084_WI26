    "We hypothesize that higher post-graduation salaries lead to a larger, more competitive applicant pool, causing a measurable increase in admitted transfer GPAs for that major. We expect to see a positive correlation between changes in major-level median salary and changes in GPA selectivity across the observed period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students tend to choose majors with better employment prospects. However, there is a time lag between observing the job market and actually applying. Students applying for the fall 2024 admission are likely to make their decisions based on the salary levels of the 2021-2022 graduates. At UCSD, many majors have enrollment limit. Therefore, the increase in the number of applicants influenced by the previous high income should lead to an increase in the admission GPA threshold in the coming years. We expect this impact to be most significant in computer science and engineering majors.\n",
    "\n",
    "How we will conduct the test: We will calculate the percentage changes in median salary and the percentile changes in admission GPA. We will conduct a correlation test to determine if the GPA increases more rapidly in professional fields with greater prior salary growth. We will also group the majors by fields (STEM, humanities) and conduct separate regression analyses to examine if there are differences in the relationships between different fields.\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "An ideal dataset would contain individual transfer applicant records from UCSD, each applicant's major, transfer GPA, admission decision, and entry year. This would let us calculate any GPA percentile we need rather than relying on pre-aggregated summaries. These applicant records would be linked to actual wage data. The earnings data would be UCSD-specific. We need four years of data (2018,2020,2022,2024) across fifteen to twenty majors to see real trends, about 100 to 150 total observations. The data would live in a secure database with student privacy protected."

    "\n",
    "This dataset contains the admission statistics of transfer students from UCSD for the years 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024, aggregated by major. The data was extracted from the university's institutional research records and provides a view of the selective trends in admission choices across 15 different majors in the fields of humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and engineering. The data structure consists of each row representing a unique combination of major and year, and all fields have been cleaned and validated for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of observations: 60 (15 majors × 4 years)\n",
    "Number of variables: 9 (Year, Major, Applicants, Admits, Enrollees, Admit GPA range, Enrollee GPA range, Admit rate, Yield rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "The column of applicants represents the total number of transfer students who submitted applications to the specific major during the admission period, and it is the main indicator for measuring the project's demand. Admissions indicate the number of applicants who were admitted. The admission rate is calculated by dividing the number of admissions by the number of applicants, reflecting the competitiveness from the perspective of the institution's enrollment capacity. The enrollment number counts the number of admitted students who eventually enrolled at the University of California, San Diego. The enrollment rate is calculated by dividing the enrollment number by the number of admissions, reflecting the attractiveness of the admission to this major compared to other institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our assumption holds that the most crucial indicator is the GPA range. The admission GPA range is expressed by the lowest and highest values (for example, \"3.41 – 3.96\"), which actually represent the middle 50% of the transfer GPAs of admitted students. The lower limit corresponds to the 25th percentile, indicating the GPA required to be a competitive candidate, while the upper limit corresponds to the 75th percentile, showing the GPA of high-performing admitted students. The admission GPA range follows the same structure but reflects the actual admitted students, excluding those who have been admitted to other institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is directly relevant to our hypothesis regarding salary-driven competition. The Admit GPA range, specifically the 25th and 75th percentiles, serves as our primary dependent variable, representing the selectivity threshold we hypothesize will rise in response to strong labor market signals. An increase in applicants in specific major driven by high salary outcomes should force admissions officers to raise the GPA floor. We can observe this by tracking changes in the lower bound of the Admit GPA range over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several limitations of this dataset should be noted. The data is grouped by major, so we cannot see individual student information like which community college they came from or where they live. Since GPA cannot go above 4.0, competitive majors like mechanical engineering often has upper bound 4.00, so if top students get even stronger, we cannot measure that improvement because the scale has a hard limit. Some majors have very few enrolling students, so their GPA averages can swing wildly based on just one or two people. \n",

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
