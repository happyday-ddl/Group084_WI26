    "From 2022 to 2024 at UC San Diego (UCSD), how do transfer-admit GPA distributions differ across ten selected majors, and how are these patterns related to major-level alumni earnings? Using data aggregated at the major × year level, we will describe admitted-GPA distributions with mean/median, standard deviation, and key percentiles (10th/25th/75th) and estimate year-to-year trends for each major. We will then merge in major-specific earnings metrics (e.g., median annual wages 2 and 5 years after graduation) and test whether majors with higher or increasing salary outcomes also show rising GPA selectivity over time. In terms of analysis, we will use correlation and regression analysis methods to relate grade point average (GPA) and alumni salary data, in order to assess the strength and significance of these relationships. The final deliverables will identify (1) which of the ten majors have the most selective GPA distributions, (2) which majors show the fastest GPA shifts, and (3) whether alumni earnings help explain or predict changes in GPA selectivity at UCSD.\n"

    "Choosing a university major is a crucial decision that impacts a student's academic trajectory and future career prospects. In recent years, there has been increasing attention to the \"return on investment\" of higher education, with prospective students often weighing the academic difficulty of a major against its potential graduate earnings. For transfer students—who typically have more defined career goals upon entering university—the competitiveness of admission (measured by the GPA distribution of admitted students (10th, 25th, and 75th percentiles)) is a primary evaluation criterion. This study uses the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as a case study, a leading public research university where transfer admission selectivity and GPA thresholds vary significantly across different disciplines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has confirmed a significant but nuanced link between university admission difficulty and post-graduation earnings. Data from the University of California Information Center suggests this relationship is particularly pronounced at highly competitive institutions like UCSD, especially in fields such as mechanical engineering and computer science, where graduates consistently rank among the highest earners five years after graduation. On the other hand, some \"pre-professional\" majors, such as human biology, maintain high GPA admission thresholds despite potentially lower undergraduate earnings compared to technical fields. This is often because these students go on to pursue advanced medical degrees, indicating that \"admission difficulty\" is not solely determined by current average salaries but also by long-term academic value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labor market conditions and alumni salary signals have also been shown to influence student demand, and consequently, the academic standards required for admission. It is widely believed that students tend to gravitate towards majors perceived to have higher economic returns, such as STEM fields and applied social sciences like business psychology. This shift in demand leads to increased admission difficulty and higher GPA admission thresholds. For example, UCSD's computer science program consistently maintains higher GPA requirements than humanities disciplines like history, directly reflecting its leading position in alumni earnings data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these observations, there is a lack of localized research specifically examining the year-to-year changes in UCSD's admission GPA distribution (2022-2024) and its correlation with real-time average salary trends for specific majors. While general research suggests that a 10% increase in expected salary increases the likelihood of students choosing a particular major by nearly 14% to 18%, it remains unclear whether these enrollment preferences immediately translate into quantifiable changes in the 10th, 25th, and 75th percentiles of matriculation GPA. This project aims to bridge the gap between educational enrollment data and labor market wage signals by analyzing ten different academic programs at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), spanning fields from history to mechanical engineering.\n",

    "1. Consistency in Elite STEM: We suspect that high-paying majors like Computer Science will keep a very tight and high GPA \"floor\" near 3.9 or 4.0 regardless of minor market fluctuations because the financial reward is so clear. This means their 25th percentile GPA will likely stay stuck at the top of the scale, showing very little room for lower-GPA students even in \"off\" years.\n",
    "2. Market Signals as Leading Indicators: We expect to see a \"lagged\" effect where a rise in a major’s median salary in one year leads to a tougher GPA requirement for transfer students a year or two later. This would prove that UCSD applicants are paying attention to which degrees are becoming more valuable in the job market and are shifting their applications accordingly.\n",
    "3. The Pre-Professional Outlier Effect: We think that \"pre-med\" majors like Human Biology will be an exception to the salary rule, keeping high GPA bars despite having lower immediate paychecks than engineering. The competition in these fields is probably fueled by the desire for high-prestige graduate school placements rather than just the first salary after college.\n"
